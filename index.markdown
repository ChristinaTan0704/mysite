I'm a final year thesis-based master student in Computer Science at <a herf="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>, supervised by professor <a herf="https://msavva.github.io/">Manolis Savva</a>. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor of Computer Science Degree from <a herf="https://en.szu.edu.cn/">Shenzhen University</a>. I am broadly interested in Computer Vision, 3D Scene Understanding, Reinforcement Learning, Embodied AI, and Robotics.
